Project 1: Spreadsheet Application with DeerLang
  - Builded a spreadsheet-like software using Haskell
  - Used functional programming to solve larger problems
  - Used higher-order functions to simplify code
  
Project 2: Spreadsheet Application with Static Type Inference
  - Builded a static type inferencer and checker for the spreadsheet language to make sure that the spreadsheet values are appropriately typed using Racket
  - Used Racket to solve type checking problems
  - Use miniKanren and constraint logic programming to solve problems like type inference and type inhabitation
