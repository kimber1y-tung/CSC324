- Create a helper to build the environment containing the sheets' definitions

- Each row requires its own environment
	- Write a helper that takes a list of value columns, and returns a list of environments (1 to 1 mapping)

- Write a helper that takes a single formula and a list of environments (from before) and returns a list of values

! Some functions will require the use of foldl

For the written explanations:
- Describe 3 of your major helper functions (at time of writing these are: getEnvironment, buildDataEnvs, doCalculations). What are their purposes, provude summaries for each.
- Reflect on the use of Haskell. What features were helpful? What was challenging?
- If working in a team, describe your contribution to the project.
